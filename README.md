## üö© Important: yt-dlp and ffmpeg Are Not Bundled

**This app does NOT bundle `yt-dlp` or `ffmpeg` inside the installer.**  
You must have both `yt-dlp` and `ffmpeg` installed on your system for the app to work.

- **On macOS:**  
  The app will check for Homebrew and prompt to install it if not present. It will then attempt to install `yt-dlp` and `ffmpeg` automatically via Homebrew if they're missing.
- **On Linux:**  
  Please install `yt-dlp` and `ffmpeg` using your package manager before use (see below).
- **On Windows:**  
  Please install [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp#installation) and [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) manually and make sure they are available in your PATH.

## Prerequisites

- **macOS:** (tested on macOS 14+)
  - [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) will be installed automatically if missing
  - `yt-dlp` and `ffmpeg` (will be installed automatically via Homebrew if missing)
- **Linux:**  
  - `yt-dlp` and `ffmpeg` (install via `apt`, `dnf`, or other package manager)
- **Windows:**  
  - `yt-dlp` and `ffmpeg` (must be installed manually and available in PATH)

## Installation

### Method 1: Direct Download (Recommended for Users)

1. Download the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/Shawshank01/yt-downloader-electron/releases) page.
2. Extract the downloaded file and run the installer for your OS:
    - **macOS:** `.dmg` (or `.zip`)
    - **Linux:** `.AppImage` or `.deb`
    - **Windows:** `.exe` installer
3. **First Run:**
    - On **macOS**, the app will try to install dependencies with Homebrew if missing.
    - On **Linux/Windows**, you must install `yt-dlp` and `ffmpeg` yourself if not already present (see troubleshooting below).

### Method 2: From Source (For Developers)

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Shawshank01/yt-downloader-electron.git
   cd yt-downloader-electron
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the application:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. **Developer note:**  
   - The app expects `yt-dlp` and `ffmpeg` to be available in your system‚Äôs PATH.
   - On macOS, you can use Homebrew; on Linux use your package manager; on Windows install them manually.

### Building Distributables (Developers)

To build the application for your platform:
```bash
npm run build
```
This will create a distributable package in the `dist` directory.
